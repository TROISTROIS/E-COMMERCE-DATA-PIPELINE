# E-COMMERCE-DATA-PIPELINE
## Project Overview
This assignment involves building a sophisticated event-driven data ingestion and
transformation pipeline focusing on e-commerce transactional data.I will design a
system using AWS services such as S3, Lambda, Glue, Redshift, EventBridge Rule, CodeBuild and SNS to ingest, transform,
validate, and upsert data into Amazon Redshift for analytical purposes.
